    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several
    times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
    flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
